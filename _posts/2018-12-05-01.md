First of all, Closure! is block style's "function type".<br>
and above Swift 3.0, Closure have default behavior as 'non-escaping'.<br>
because 'non-escaping' has more benefit of memory management.<br>
<br>
1. What is 'non-escaping'?<br>
   - 'non-escaping' closure has same behavior any other local properties in its function.<br>
<br>
<b>summary</b><br>
1) timing side: Executed at called time exactly.<br>
2) memory side: Released when function was returned.
```swift
func main() {
    // 1. Call function.
    sum { [weak self] result in
        // 4. Result closure block executed.
        print(result)
    }
}
func sum(result: ((Int) -> ())) {
    // 2. Do something.
    var sum = 0
    for value in [1, 2, 3] {
        sum += value
    }
    // 3. result closue called.
    result(sum)
    // 5. Funcion was returned.
}
```
<br>
2. What is 'escaping'?<br>
   - 'escaping' closure is can say it's like stored global/member property.<br>
  so, there is two typical situation you need to annotate "escaping" when using closure.<br>
  first. no guarantee of when closure called as timing side.<br>
  second. you want to save closure as global/member property as memory side.<br>
<br>
<b>summary</b><br>
1) timing side: May be executed after function was returned. (network, delay, async...)
```swift
func main() {
    // 1. Call function.
    sum { [weak self] result in
        // 4. Result closure block executed.
        print(result)
    }
}
func sum(result: @escaping ((Int) -> ())) {
    // 2. Do something.
    var sum = 0
    for value in [1, 2, 3] {
        sum += value
    }
    // 3. call result closure delayed.
    DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.3) {
        result(sum)
    }
}
```
2) memory side: Closure memory was no released than stored as global/member property.
```swift
var storedClosure: ((Int) -> ())!
func main() {
    // 1. Call function.
    sum { [weak self] result in
        print(result)
    }
}
func sum(result: @escaping ((Int) -> ())) {
    // 2. Do something.
    var sum = 0
    for value in [1, 2, 3] {
        sum += value
    }
    // 3. Assign result closure to storedClosure.
    storedClosure = result
}
```
<br>
2. What about optional closure?<br>
   - Optional closure is equal to escaping closure.<br>
     technically, optional closure is enum type not function type.<br>
     means it can be any type.<br>
     so, 'swift' define optional closure has annotation of escaping implicitly.
```swift
func main() {
    // 1. Call function.
    sum { [weak self] result in
        // 4. Result closure block executed.
        print(result)
    }
}
func sum(result: ((Int) -> ())?) {
    // 2. Do something.
    var sum = 0
    for value in [1, 2, 3] {
        sum += value
    }
    // 3. Delay called optional result closure.
    DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.3) {
        result?(sum)
    }
}
```
