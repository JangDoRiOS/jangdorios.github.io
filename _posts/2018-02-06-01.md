You can get Photolibray folder's localizedTitle using PHAssetCollection.

```swift
let albums = PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with: .smartAlbum, subtype: .any, options: nil)
for album in albums.objects(at: IndexSet(0...albums.count - 1)) {
    let photos = PHAsset.fetchAssets(in: album, options: nil)
    if photos.count > 0 {
        print(album.localizedTitle!, "/", photos.count)
    }
}
```

This code works perfectly.

But, if you want to get localizedTitle, not english
maybe it doesn't work correctly and returning english only.

I don't know it is bug or something, though there is solution for this
PHAssetCollection's localizedTitle looks like has dependent to project localization langauge

Add language there and run again, it will return localizedTitle precisely. ^_^)b
