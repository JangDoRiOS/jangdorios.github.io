UIDeviceOrientationDidChange with rxSwift is very useful.<br />
<br />
Here is some example code.

```swift
let name = NSNotification.Name.UIDeviceOrientationDidChange
let notificationRx = NotificationCenter.default.rx.notification(name).takeUntil(rx.deallocated)
_ = notificationRx.skip(0.5, scheduler: MainScheduler.instance).subscribe { notification in
    switch UIDevice.current.orientation {
    case .portrait, .landscapeLeft, .landscapeRight:
        print(UIDevice.current.orientation, UIScreen.main.bounds.size)
        completion(UIDevice.current.orientation)
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

Rotate device portrait to landscape in inital ViewContoller, print log is display like this.<br />
(375.0, 812.0)<br />
(375.0, 812.0)<br />
(375.0, 812.0)<br />
(812.0, 375.0)<br />
It could be occur some timing issue...<br />
<br />
But Rotate device portrait to landscape not in inital ViewContoller, print log is display like this.<br />
(812.0, 375.0)<br />
(812.0, 375.0)<br />
(812.0, 375.0)<br />
(812.0, 375.0)<br />
Yeah!, this is result, what i want.<br />
<br />
I Don't know why rxSwift acting like this.
